# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
This was the most challeging assignment for me. But also the most entertaining somehow. Putting all past lesson skills into one was interesting! Slowing down and really reading the instructions helped. Talking out loud also seemed to help.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
This week was different. There was alot of random things going on in my personal life and distractions with outside construction on my street. Taking a break when work wasnt flowing made me come back once things settled. Staying focused during the noise was hard. But I threw on some headphones to get dialed in.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
How effective irb can be! I really used it during this assignment. And it was awesome. I was able to test my code and make some edits with variables at the same time. Its super effective and a great tool. Apart from that, I learned my codes flow better if I end them prematurly. Like if I start a class then I'll place an end where it should be. Then the same with my if statements. Keeping my code blocks organized help me stay more focused and clear.
